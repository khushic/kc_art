        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">RISE ENGLISH GROUP & OUR CLIENTS</b>
        <br/><br/>
        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">Who are our clients?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        Our clients are advanced English speakers who want to build confidence and be fluent in English. They might be optimists or realists, disciplined master planners or naturally disorganized beings that don’t enjoy studying but are working hard to become trained creatures of habit. They’re from all over the world, lead busy lives and all share two common goals: <b>they want to improve their English and have committed to investing in themselves.</b> They are highly motivated to do what it takes. They’ve made the sacrifice and have set aside time to better themselves and do what is necessary to achieve their goals and become the person they want to be. <b>They’ve decided that they are worth it.</b>
        <br/><br/>

        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">What do we offer?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        We offer online English conversation classes in a positive, non-judgemental environment with English coaches who are native speakers and CELTA certified by the University of Cambridge. Our classes are 55 minutes long and are one-on-one. We’ll also send you notes after your English class that will include the errors you made while speaking with our corrections. This gives you the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and to be one step closer to achieving your English goals.
        <br/><br/>


        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">BECOMING CONFIDENT, ACHIEVING ENGLISH FLUENCY & TIME FRAMES TO SUCCESS</b>
        <br/><br/>
        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">How will English conversation classes help me build confidence and speak English fluently?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        We foster a positive, non-judgemental atmosphere so that you feel comfortable to speak English fluently, take risks and test those new phrases you’ve heard that native English speaker from work say. You’ll practice listening and speaking skills during your English conversation class which is the fastest way to increase your confidence, improve your conversational skills and become a fluent English speaker.
        <br/><br/>
        Our goal is for you to feel excited about the process of becoming fluent and to help you strengthen your confidence when you speak English so you can improve your English fluency faster. Attending English conversation classes frequently will lead to the language flowing naturally from you, as if second nature. You won’t worry about if what you said was grammatically correct or pause mid-conversation because you couldn’t remember what you were going to say. <b>With time, your nervousness will disappear and it’ll be replaced with confidence.</b> You’ll start to notice the results of your commitment because you’ll be transforming into your future self as your confidence grows and your English fluency increases.
        <br/><br/>
        English conversation classes with a native English speaker will also help you improve your pronunciation consciously and subconsciously. We’re trained to subtly provide pronunciation corrections during the conversation so that over time, you’ll begin to correct yourself automatically, often unknowingly. Through English conversation classes you’ll train your brain to push through the challenging moments and you’ll build the confidence you need to speak with any native English speaker. If you commit to yourself and put in the time, you won’t be disappointed with the results.
        <br/><br/><br/>

        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">How long will it take me to feel confident and speak English fluently?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        Truthfully, your time frame to success is completely up to you. First ask yourself: <i>how do I define my success and what am I willing to sacrifice to get there?</i> Then imagine what your life will be like when you are your future self and you’ve achieved your goals. Do you feel happier and more confident? Are the doors of opportunity constantly opening and leading to new adventures? Are you travelling the world and able to communicate with 90% of the people you meet because English is the common language spoken? Are you at the top of your professional game because you’re the only person at work who speaks English fluently? What you imagine for yourself is up to you, but we’re guessing it’s something along the lines of <b>amazing.</b>
        <br/><br/>
        When learning another language you get what you give. <b>The more time you invest in yourself, the faster you’ll see results.</b> As an advanced English speaker, you know that to excel requires commitment. Our general guideline is the more often you speak with native English speakers the better so that you can build confidence and train your brain to think in English. As David DeAngelo said, <b>“Persistence is the price of success.”</b> We believe that this ideal applies to all areas of our lives and we’re here to help you become your future self, a fluent English speaker who is beaming with confidence.
        <br/><br/><br/>

        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">Why is it important to speak with a native English speaker instead of a person who speaks English, but whose native language isn’t English?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        Have you ever heard people say, “Do it right the first time or put time aside to fix it later”? The same applies to when you learn English. Don’t get us wrong. You should speak English fluently in every opportunity presented to you, but when you choose an English coach, <b>it really comes down to your goals.</b> Do you want to speak English fluently with minimal errors? Do you want to perfect your pronunciation and sound like a native speaker? If you do, then speaking with a native English speaker is really important.
        <br/><br/>
        When we speak with others often, we tend to acquire their habits and tendencies whether we realize it or not. If you speak English with someone frequently who isn’t a native English speaker, you may absorb their grammatical and pronunciation errors and start to make them yourself.
        <br/><br/>
        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">It truly depends on how you envision yourself as an English speaker and the commitment you’re willing to make to yourself.</b> When you imagine your future self speaking English fluently, do you blend in among the crowd of native speakers? Does your accent mirror that of a native English speaker?  Do people think that English is your native language? If you want to speak English like a native English speaker then you’ve come to the right place. Rise English Group will help you achieve your goals and become fluent in English faster.
        <br/><br/><br/>

        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">What’s the benefit of talking with an experienced English coach instead of talking to my friend who speaks English?</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The short answer: It’s all about you. Friendships are wonderful, but they’re a balance of sharing, of give and take. We want you to speak English guilt free and not worry about being a good friend who gives back. <b>Your English conversation class is all about you.</b> Of course, there’s still a flowing two-way conversation, but we’re here to help you advance your goals, not dominate the conversation and tell you all about our priorities in life.
        <br/><br/>
        <b style="font-size: 2.5rem">As experienced English coaches, we’re here to support you.</b> We foster a conversation in which you feel comfortable to flourish. If you love to talk, we’re excellent listeners- and we’re here to be your sounding board. We’re excited to be your biggest cheerleader, to listen to your goals and to help you achieve them.
        <br/><br/>
        We’re also trained in helpful error correction methods: Restated Repetition Correction (RRC) and Delayed Correction (DC). RRC is when a learner makes an error when speaking and we repeat the statement back to them correctly. We do this casually when appropriate so as not to break the flow in the conversation and interrupt the speaker’s fluidity. We also offer DC when the time is right so that they can learn from our feedback and improve their English conversation skills immediately.
