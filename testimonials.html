    <p class="testimonial-text">I am so happy to have met my English coach. Since taking classes, my English has improved significantly. She is a very attentive teacher with a lot of patience. After every completed lesson, she always gives me a rating, which has helped me a lot. The fact that she also speaks Spanish is also very helpful, if I don't know any English words I can ask her in Spanish. All in one, so a good teacher and 100% recommendable!!

    <p class="testimonial-text">My English coach is awesome! I've booked many regular conversations with her and           I think that helped a lot! I enjoy talking with her and I'm really happy we made the connection. Also, she is a very detail-oriented person! She will send you the correction notes after finishing the conversation which is quite helpful! I really appreciate I met her and you won't be disappointed, believe me!

    <p class="testimonial-text">I have been practicing my speaking skills with my English coach for a while, and to tell you the truth I had changed several tutors from other companies before I found my current English coach. What I like the most about our classes is that you do not, and, moreover, cannot control the time of the lesson. It flies. This is awesome, when you don’t use a book during the lesson, you don’t check your homework, you just speak. Whenever you speak, with or without mistakes you are practicing your speaking skills, because sometimes when people always interrupt you to point out your every your error, you   can easily forget the notion of your answer. After each lesson you get feedback with your common mistakes in grammar. Thus, you can identify your lack of grammar skills too. My English coach’s conversational classes are excellent for those who might think  of improving their vocabulary in various fields, building confidence and overall English. Your lessons might cover everything around you, from everyday routine to economy, from politics to environmental problems and traveling, and many, many others.

    <p class="testimonial-text">I enjoy learning in my conversational classes. My coach is very patient and knowledgeable and will make sure that you will learn by providing detailed corrections on your grammar and on the spot coaching to further improve your pronunciation. I can see that I will achieve my goal on perfecting my skills in using the language. That’s why I highly recommend an English coach to anyone who wants to improve and is interested in learning the English language.

    <p class="testimonial-text">I’ve been working with my coach for quite some time now and I already feel more confident talking English. She makes you feel comfortable and she brings the best out of you. She tailors the lessons according to your needs. She always brings a positive energy and more importantly she’s a sweetheart. The one thing that I really appreciate about her is the fact that she writes down your mistakes as we go along so you can focus on them and improve quickly. I STRONGLY recommend her as an English coach!
